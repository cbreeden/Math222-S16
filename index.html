            The TAs for this course have collective decided that we would hold "floating" office-hours.
            This means that you are free to attend any TA's office hours in the course.  The table below lists
            all TA office-hours.  Which reminds me, have you thanked a TA today? :)

               <h3>Quizzes and Homework</h3> There will be <em>no makeup quizzes</em>. However, the <em>two lowest quiz scores will be dropped</em>. Homework assignments and due dates will be posted on the homework web page. <em>No late homework</em> will be accepted. Each assignment will be collected at the beginning of the discussion when it is due. To ensure students in different sections are treated equally, all TAs will give quizzes at the beginning of the discussion after questions from the students are answered; so you will need to show up to discussions on time.</li>

            <li>
               <h3>Learn@UW</h3> All grades will be promptly posted on Learn@UW. If you find an error in your posted grades, let your TA know as soon as possible. Please be sure you are familiar with accessing Learn@UW. Try to avoid waiting until the end of the semester to contest grading. If you want to contest a grading error in Learn@UW, you will need to have a copy of your homework or quiz to prove that there was a grading mistake in Learn@UW and there shouldn't be any reasonable suspecion that the assignment was not tampered with; waiting until the last minute only increases suspecion.</li>

         <h2>Student Resources</h2>

         <p>If you are concerned about your background for Math 222, you may want to review materials from Math 221. Some old Math 221 exams can be found in <a href="http://www.library.wisc.edu/math/services/course-reserves/">this link</a>. Reviewing differentiation and integration will be a good start for the semester. Understanding lectures and the TA discussions is important for you to learn the materials. You cannot learn math by watching how other people are doing. Do not fall behind on weekly homework assignments. Show work and justifications in homework. If you need extra help, don't hesitate to contact me. Besides office hours held by me or Professor Gong, there are other resources worth looking at:</p>

         <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mathlab">MathLab</a> - Free drop-in tutoring is available in B227 Van Vleck, Monday through Thursday from 3:30 AM - 8:30 PM and Sunday 3:30 AM - 6:50 PM.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/tprogram">Math Tutorial Program</a> - Free small group tutoring is offered to students who may be failing, students who have not had a math course in several years, or students who are retaking the course. A significant time commitment is required. Any student can apply to the program, but after the first four weeks of the semester, a referral from an instructor is required. Students may apply in room 320 Van Vleck. If you feel like you may need a referral, you can talk to me or Professor Gong about it.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.housing.wisc.edu/residencehalls-academics-tutoring.htm">Tutoring in the University Residence Halls</a> - Free drop-in math tutoring is available at various residence halls.</li>
            <li><a href="http://guts.studentorg.wisc.edu/">GUTS</a> - Greater University Tutoring Service offers free small group, individual, and drop-in tutoring at various locations around campus. It is staffed mostly by student volunteers. Stop by their office (333 East Campus Mall, Rm. 4413) to sign up for a tutor or try <a href="http://guts.studentorg.wisc.edu/programs/di.html">drop-in</a> tutoring.</li>

         <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
         <p>I expect you to finish and hand in work on time. Being late to lectures or discussions, leaving early, using electronic devices which are not related to learning in this class, are disrespectful and disruptive to your instructors and your fellow students.</p>

         <p>You are expected to hold the academic integrity of this University. You are allowed to work in groups when you discuss homework. However, you must write your own solutions. On quizzes and exams, academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to) looking at another student’s paper and using references or devices which are not permitted. We treat all incidents of academic dishonesty very seriously. For instance, the consequences for cheating on an exam may result in automatically failing the course. Such an incident will be reported to the Dean of Students Office. For details about academic integrity, visit the web page in <a href="https://www.students.wisc.edu/doso/academic-integrity/">Dean of Students Office</a>.</p>
