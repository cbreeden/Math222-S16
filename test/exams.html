        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Here you can find the schedule for all of the quizzes and exams in this course.  Remember, there are <em>no</em> makeup quizzes, but the two lowest quiz scores will be dropped.</p>

        <p>I will post the quizzes and exams after every student has taken it.  I will also post try to post solutions.  This will be a very good study resource as the final exam will consist of problems <em>very similar</em> to the ones found here; so if you do nothing else in this course, at least make sure you understand these problems <em>very well</em>.</p>

        <p>The University requires that you take the final exam at the scheduled time shown above. For any conflict with midterms, please let me and Professor Gong know <em>two weeks prior</em> to the exam. Make-up exams will cover the same topics as the regular exams, although they may look completely different.</p>
